# laravel-phpreports
A package implementation of PHPReports intended to work with Laravel.

This implementation intends to develop a way to implement PHPReports, an useful framework developed by Jeremy Dorn to display reports, into the latest version of Laravel (5.3).

This is a work in progress and does not promise to work as of right now. Use to your own risk.
